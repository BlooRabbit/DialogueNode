# DialogueNode

Godot Engine standalone node system for using jsons made with Levrault's dialogue editor. 

The idea was to provide a very simple standalone script to use the json files. Display is pretty basic and can easily be customized. Just change the UI nodes and adapt the beginning of the script. The script is commented in order to make customization easier.

The editor itself can be found here, with instructions for use : https://github.com/Levrault/LE-dialogue-editor
