# DialogueNode

Godot Engine standalone node system for using jsons made with Levrault's LeDialogue editor. 

The LeDialogue editor creates json files for dialogs, with various possibilities, based on a visual node system. It is very easy to use and was made to work with all sorts of game engines. It supports localization, which is very useful. Thanks to Levrault for creating it.

My idea was to provide a very simple standalone script to use the json files made with the editor in Godot Engine Games. Display is pretty basic but it can easily be customized. Just change the UI nodes and adapt the beginning of the script. The script is commented in order to make customization easier.

The editor itself can be found here, with instructions for use : https://github.com/Levrault/LE-dialogue-editor
